 C++ library using cross language communication with Python Sympy for symbolic math.

 Status: **WIP**

 ## Project Structure

 - Commmunication

    Here we put files that are used in the communication subsystem for communicating with Python.

- Modules

    Here we put classes that extend the Module class in their own folder with another subfolder that defines its own FunctionDescriptor classes.
